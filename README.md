# Sentiment_Analysis

Here I tried to make sentiment analysis using the tensorflow.

Sentiment analysis is the contextual study that aims to determine the opinions, feelings,
outlooks, moods and emotions of people towards entities and their aspects. The primitive
functions of sentiment analysis are emotion recognition that focuses on extracting a cluster of
emotion labels and polarity detection which aims to classify the writerâ€™s attitude as positive,
negative and neutral.
